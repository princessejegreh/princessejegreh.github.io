My name is Princess Ejegreh.  I graduated from Thornwood High School located in South Holland, IL in May 2016.  I was born in Lagos, Nigeria and came to America when I was five years old with my mother Julie.  I am a very loving person who tends to communicate with other people in the most respectable manner possible.  I came to Tougaloo College because I heard of its reputation in raising Mississippiâ€™s finest doctors. One day I hope to achieve my dream of becoming a general surgeon.  I know that it will require a lot of work, but I will get through it because I have been passionate about the science field ever since I was young and able to observe my mom in her work setting as a Nurse.  I hope that in these 4 years I can grow as an individual and achieve my goal of graduating college with a Biology degree.
